# As The Crow Flies

## Synopsis

This is a toy web app that I wrote using [Python][1]/[Flask][2] as part of
a job application for a developer position at a startup in London.  It consists
of a web service and web page that calculate the "as the crow flies" distance
between the user's location and [White Bear Yard][3] at 144A Clerkenwell Road,
London, EC1R 5DF, UK.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the web service:

* [Python][1]
* [Flask][2]
* [Requests][4]

The end user is expected to be using a modern W3C compliant browser that
supports the [W3C geolocation][5] specifications.  My personal favourite is
[Google Chrome][6].

## Setup

MORE TO COME HERE...

The [Flask][2] documentation has some good tutorials about how to deploy the
web service ([here][7] and [here][8]) on your particular server environment.
